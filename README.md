# Dynamic Duo

A data science project on the US cross border entry dataset from 1996 to 2019 that aims to:

- brainstorm explorative feature ideas and conduct feature engineering
- predict the border cross entry value using regression models
- apply time series analysis on the border crossing seasonal patterns
- detect anomalies in the dataset for case study and for other components

# Dataset used:

- US border-crossing entry dataset from 1996 to 2019 (from Kaggle)
- US historical average temperature by state from 1996 to 2019 (from noaa.gov)
- US quarterly GDP data by state from 2005 to 2019 (from bea.gov)
